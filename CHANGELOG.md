## [9.0.6] - 2025-06-14

This is a service update that focuses on package dependencies and a minor new handy feature; `Cuemon.Threading.Awaiter.RunUntilSuccessfulOrTimeoutAsync` method.

### Added

- Awaiter class in the Cuemon.Threading namespace that provides a set of static methods for awaiting asynchronous operations:
  - RunUntilSuccessfulOrTimeoutAsync repeatedly invokes a specified asynchronous lambda expression until it succeeds or a configured timeout is reached


## [9.0.5] - 2025-05-13

This is a service update that focuses on package dependencies and a few bug fixes.

### Added

- SecureHashAlgorithm512256 class in the Cuemon.Security.Cryptography namespace that provides a SHA-512-256 implementation of the SHA (Secure Hash Algorithm) cryptographic hashing algorithm for 512-bit hash values
- SHA512256 class in the Cuemon.Security.Cryptography namespace that represents the SHA-512/256 cryptographic hash algorithm, which produces a 256-bit hash value using the SHA-512 algorithm as its base
- DigestCryptoAlgorithm enum in the Cuemon.AspNetCore.Authentication.Digest namespace that specifies the supported digest algorithms for HTTP Digest Access Authentication
- DigestHashFactory class in the Cuemon.AspNetCore.Authentication.Digest namespace that provides access to factory methods for creating and configuring Hash instances based on UnkeyedCryptoHash{TAlgorithm}

- UnkeyedCryptoAlgorithm enum in the Cuemon.Security.Cryptography namespace was extended with a new value: Sha512Slash256
- UnkeyedHashFactory class in the Cuemon.Security.Cryptography namespace was extended with a new method: CreateCryptoSha512Slash256
- DigestAuthenticationOptions class in the Cuemon.AspNetCore.Authentication.Digest namespace was extended with a property named DigestAlgorithm that specifies the digest algorithm to use for HTTP Digest Access Authentication; default is DigestCryptoAlgorithm.Sha256

### Fixed

- DigestAuthenticationHandler class in the Cuemon.AspNetCore.Authentication.Digest namespace to use newly added DigestCryptoAlgorithm enum in the Cuemon.AspNetCore.Authentication.Digest namespace
- DigestAuthenticationMiddleware class in the Cuemon.AspNetCore.Authentication.Digest namespace to use newly added DigestCryptoAlgorithm enum in the Cuemon.AspNetCore.Authentication.Digest namespace

## [9.0.4] - 2025-04-10

This is a service update that focuses on package dependencies and a few bug fixes.

> [!WARNING]
> The fix applied to the `DigestAuthenticationHandler`, `DigestAuthenticationMiddleware`, and `DigestAuthorizationHeader` classes in the `Cuemon.AspNetCore.Authentication.Digest` namespace changes both the `WWW-Authenticate` and `Authorization` headers. Justification for this patch is mentioned in [GitHub Issue #115](https://github.com/gimlichael/Cuemon/issues/115), but may affect existing implementations that rely on the previous behavior.

### Fixed

- Updated the `DigestAuthenticationHandler` class in the `Cuemon.AspNetCore.Authentication.Digest` namespace to remove quoted string values for the `stale` and `algorithm` parameters,
- Updated the `DigestAuthenticationMiddleware` class in the `Cuemon.AspNetCore.Authentication.Digest` namespace to remove quoted string values for the `stale` and `algorithm` parameters,
- Updated the `DigestAuthorizationHeader` class in the `Cuemon.AspNetCore.Authentication.Digest` namespace to:
  - Remove quoted string values for the `algorithm`, `qop`, and `nc` parameters,
  - Exclude the `stale` parameter and mark the previous implementation as obsolete,
  - Address issues outlined in [GitHub Issue #115](https://github.com/gimlichael/Cuemon/issues/115).

## [9.0.3] - 2025-03-31

This is a service update that focuses on package dependencies.

## [9.0.2] - 2025-03-31

This is a service update that focuses on package dependencies.

### Fixed

- Disposable class in the Cuemon namespace to set the disposed flag to true immediately after the Dispose method is called after thread safety check (previously it was set to true after the Dispose method had completed)

## [9.0.1] - 2024-01-28

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> The following projects has been removed with this release and migrated to [Codebelt](https://github.com/codebeltnet):
> 
> - Cuemon.Extensions.Globalization was removed from the solution and migrated to [Codebelt.Extensions.Globalization](https://github.com/codebeltnet/globalization)
>
> Dependencies used for targeting .NET Standard 2.0 has been updated to use .NET 8.0 (LTS) instead of .NET Core 2.1.

> - Cuemon.Extensions.AspNetCore.Authentication.AwsSignature4 was removed from the solution and migrated to [Codebelt.Extensions.AwsSignature4](https://github.com/codebeltnet/aws-signature-v4)

> [!NOTE]
> Types that are removed from this solution (but otherwise fits naturally together) will be migrated to smaller and more focused repositories in the [Codebelt](https://github.com/codebeltnet) organization, renamed to better reflect their purpose and published as standalone packages on NuGet.
>
> - [Codebelt.Unitify](https://github.com/codebeltnet/unitify) is an example of a repository that received types from this solution and is now a standalone library that provides a uniform way of working with prefixes and multiples in the context of units of measure.

This major release is first and foremost focused on ironing out any wrinkles that have been introduced with .NET 9 preview releases so the final release is production ready together with the official launch from Microsoft.
