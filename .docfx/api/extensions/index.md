# Other Projects

Here is a collection of various non-Microsoft APIs that was adapted by Cuemon for .NET to provide an abundance of enhancements, new features and extension methods.

## xUnit API

[xUnit.net](https://xunit.net/) has from day one been the preferred unit test platform for Cuemon for .NET and it was only natural to extend upon xUnit for even more advanced unit test scenarios.

## Json.NET API

I am a huge fan of [Json.NET](https://www.newtonsoft.com/json) written by [James Newton-King](https://github.com/JamesNK) and the flexible architecture this JSON framework adds to the toolbelt.

So even though Microsoft decided to write their own [JSON framework](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.text.json) (first seen with the release of ASP.NET Core 3), Cuemon for .NET will continue to support and extend Json.NET as the natural companion of our framework.

## Asp.Versioning API

Our preferred way of versioning Open API/Swagger for RESTful APIs is done through [Asp.Versioning](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnet-api-versioning).

## Swashbuckle.AspNetCore API

[Swashbuckle.AspNetCore](https://github.com/domaindrivendev/Swashbuckle.AspNetCore) defined the standard for Open API/Swagger which we built upon to provide an even more powerful and efficient way of documenting your RESTful APIs.

## AWS Signature API

Providing an additional HTTP HMAC Authentication header that provides a fluent way to use [AWS Signature Version 4](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/reference-for-signature-version-4.html) was a fun challenge to write and add to Cuemon for .NET .
