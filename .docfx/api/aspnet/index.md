# ASP.NET Core API

ASP.NET Core API, that is part of Cuemon for .NET, is a toolbelt of assemblies designed to be intuitive and follow the same namespace declarations as we have been accustomed by [Microsoft.AspNetCore](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/?view=aspnetcore-8.0) which is included in the .NET platform by Microsoft.

## Cuemon.AspNetCore

The `Cuemon.AspNetCore` namespace contains types focusing on providing means for easier plumber coding in the ASP.NET Core pipeline while serving some concrete implementation of the shell as well. The namespace is an addition to the `Microsoft.AspNetCore` namespace.

## Cuemon.AspNetCore.Authentication

The `Cuemon.AspNetCore.Authentication` namespace contains types that enable support for authentication using the concept of an Authenticator, AuthorizationHeader and (to tie the knots) an AuthorizationHeaderBuilder. Basic-, Digest Access- and HMAC Authentication is provided out-of-the-box. The namespace is an addition to the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication` namespace.
