# Breaking Changes
- CHANGED MiddlewareTestFactory class in the Cuemon.Extensions.Xunit.Hosting.AspNetCore namespace received a long overdue change of signature from Action{IApplicationBuilder} pipelineSetup, Action{IServiceCollection} serviceSetup --> Action{IServiceCollection} serviceSetup, Action{IApplicationBuilder} pipelineSetup as this is more logical, intuitive and in consistency with GenericHostTestFactory
