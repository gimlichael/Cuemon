- CHANGED DigestAuthenticationHandler class in the Cuemon.AspNetCore.Authentication.Digest namespace to propagate IAuthenticateResultFeature and IHttpAuthenticationFeature as part of HandleChallengeAsync

# Breaking Changes
- CHANGED TryAuthenticate{T} signature on the static Authenticator class in the Cuemon.AspNetCore.Authentication namespace to honor the otherwise suggested Try-Parse pattern (although breaking the method was assessed to have low risk of external callers)
- CHANGED Authenticate{T} signature on the static Authenticator class in the Cuemon.AspNetCore.Authentication namespace to return a ClaimsPrincipal (wrapped inside a ConditionalValue) instead of assigning this directly to the User of the HttpContext instance (although breaking the method was assessed to have low risk of external callers)
 
# New Features
- ADDED BasicAuthenticationHandler class in the Cuemon.AspNetCore.Authentication.Basic namespace to provide a HTTP Basic Authentication implementation of AuthenticationHandler{TOptions}
- ADDED DigestAuthenticationHandler class in the Cuemon.AspNetCore.Authentication.Digest namespace to provide a HTTP Digest Access Authentication implementation of AuthenticationHandler{TOptions}
- ADDED HmacAuthenticationHandler class in the Cuemon.AspNetCore.Authentication.Hmac namespace to provide a HTTP HMAC Authentication implementation of AuthenticationHandler{TOptions}
 
# Improvements
- CHANGED BasicAuthenticationMiddleware class in the Cuemon.AspNetCore.Authentication.Basic namespace to be slightly more reusable in the confines of the Cuemon.AspNetCore.Authentication assembly
- CHANGED BasicAuthenticationOptions class in the Cuemon.AspNetCore.Authentication.Basic namespace to include ValidateOptions to ensure that public read-write properties are in a valid state
- CHANGED AuthenticationOptions class in the Cuemon.AspNetCore.Authentication namespace to inherit from AuthenticationSchemeOptions and implement IValidatableParameterObject (replacing earlier IParameterObject) that ensures UnauthorizedMessage property is in a valid state
- CHANGED DigestAuthenticationMiddleware class in the Cuemon.AspNetCore.Authentication.Digest namespace to be slightly more reusable in the confines of the Cuemon.AspNetCore.Authentication assembly
- CHANGED DigestAuthenticationOptions class in the Cuemon.AspNetCore.Authentication.Digest namespace to include ValidateOptions to ensure that public read-write properties are in a valid state
- CHANGED DigestAuthorizationHeaderBuilder class in the Cuemon.AspNetCore.Authentication.Digest namespace to include an extra overload of AddFromWwwAuthenticateHeader that accepts an instance of HttpResponseHeaders
- CHANGED HmacAuthenticationMiddleware class in the Cuemon.AspNetCore.Authentication.Hmac namespace to be slightly more reusable in the confines of the Cuemon.AspNetCore.Authentication assembly
- CHANGED HmacAuthenticationOptions class in the Cuemon.AspNetCore.Authentication.Hmac namespace to include ValidateOptions to ensure that public read-write properties are in a valid state
- CHANGED HmacAuthorizationHeaderBuilder class in the Cuemon.AspNetCore.Authentication.Digest namespace to include an extra overload of AddFromRequest that accepts an instance of HttpRequestMessage
 
# Bug Fixes
- FIXED DigestAuthenticationOptions class in the Cuemon.AspNetCore.Authentication.Digest namespace to include UseServerSideHa1Storage that finally allows the server to bypass calculation of HA1 password representation
