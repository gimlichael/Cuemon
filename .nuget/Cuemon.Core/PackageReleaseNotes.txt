# Bug Fixes
- FIXED Alphanumeric class in the Cuemon namespace so that the WhiteSpace constant field does not include the U+180E (Mongolian vowel separator) since it is no longer considered a white space as per Unicode 6.3.0
- FIXED ExceptionConverter class in the Cuemon.Text.Yaml.Converters namespace to use Environment.NewLine instead of Alphanumeric.NewLine (vital for non-Windows operating systems)
 
Version 8.2.0

# ALM
- CHANGED Dependencies to latest and greatest with respect to TFMs
 
# Bug Fixes

# Improvements
- CHANGED Validator class in the Cuemon namespace to ease on constraint from IValidatableParameterObject --> IParameterObject on ThrowIfInvalidConfigurator and ThrowIfInvalidOptions; functionality remains the same but opens up for more flexibility
- CHANGED YamlSerializer class in the Cuemon.Runtime.Serialization namespace so it is consistent with other serializers/formatters in the Cuemon family

# Bug Fixes
- FIXED YamlTextWriter class in the Cuemon.Runtime.Serialization namespace to be slightly more compliant with the YAML standard (next major version will opt-in for a 3rd party library that adhere to the standard in both terms of serializing and deserializing)
