# Improvements
- ADDED tooling/gse to the solution folder that is used for extracting NLS surrogates; this was done to mitigate the original design decision that was most [unfortunate](https://github.com/gimlichael/Cuemon/commit/71ff4f9ecb95897170aab1e6ba894c320ae095bd)
 - gse stands for globalization surrogates extractor
