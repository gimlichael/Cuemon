# Upgrade Steps
- Some features (such as Memoization techniques and GetOrAdd convenience) was moved to the Cuemon.Extensions.Runtime.Caching namespace as extension methods (to keep the ICacheEnumerable{TKey} slim)
- The extent of refactoring applied to this project resulted in so many breaking changes that a git diff is advisable
 
# Breaking Changes
- CHANGED CachingManager class to return a singleton of SlimMemoryCache with default options (kept for legacy and convenience)
- REPLACED Cache class in the Cuemon.Runtime.Caching namespace with CacheEntry and split the cache invalidation part into its own class; CacheInvalidation
- REPLACED CacheCollection class in the Cuemon.Runtime.Caching namespace with SlimMemoryCache
 
# New Features
- ADDED CacheEntry class in the Cuemon.Runtime.Caching namespace that represents an individual cache entry in the cache
- ADDED CacheInvalidation class in the Cuemon.Runtime.Caching namespace that represents a set of eviction and expiration details for a specific cache entry
- ADDED ICacheEnumerable{TKey} interface in the Cuemon.Runtime.Caching namespace that is used to provide cache implementations for an application
- ADDED SlimMemoryCache class in the Cuemon.Runtime.Caching namespace that represents the type that implements an in-memory cache for an application
- ADDED SlimMemoryCacheOptions class in the Cuemon.Runtime.Caching namespace that specifies options related to SlimMemoryCache
