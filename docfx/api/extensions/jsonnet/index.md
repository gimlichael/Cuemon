# Extensions for Json.NET API

I am a huge fan of [Json.NET](https://www.newtonsoft.com/json) written by [James Newton-King](https://github.com/JamesNK) and the flexible architecture this JSON framework adds to the toolbelt.

So eventhough Microsoft decided to write their own [JSON framework](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.text.json) (first seen with the release of ASP.NET Core 3), **Cuemon for .NET** will continue to support and extend Json.NET as the natural companion of our framework.
