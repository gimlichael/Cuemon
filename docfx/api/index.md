# Concept Reference

**Cuemon for .NET** was born out of simple idea; follow the design guidelines in the book Framework Design Guidelines by Krzysztof Cwalina and Brad Abrams while staying true to always follow the namespace of Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0.

A lot of water has passed under the bridge since the first version of **Cuemon .NET Framework Additions**, which consisted of only four assemblies and was closed source from 2008 till 2015.

Fast forwarding till today, **Cuemon for .NET** has matured and grown to be a reference project for all coders, programmers, developers and the likes thereof; programmed with passion and love for .NET, C# and software architecture in general.

With that prelude, lets look at the concepts behind the work.

## The literature behind Cuemon for .NET

The constant of the code being written for **Cuemon for .NET** has and will always be **Framework Design Guidelines: Conventions, Idioms, and Patterns for Reusable .NET Libraries**. In more recent history, [Engineering Guidelines](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/wiki/Engineering-guidelines) from Microsoft ASP.NET Core team, has also been widely adapted into this project.

Here is a non-exhausting list of literature and websites that inspired and kept me going:
