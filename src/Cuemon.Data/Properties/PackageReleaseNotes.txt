- REFACTORED DataManager class in the Cuemon.Data namespace to have a higher cohesion and lower coupling
- RENAMED StringDataReader class in the Cuemon.Data namespace to DataReader{T} (including major refactoring of the underlying code)
- RENAMED DataParameterEqualityComparer class in the Cuemon.Data namespace to DbParameterEqualityComparer
- REMOVED DataTransferSorter class from the Cuemon.Data namespace
- REMOVED CsvDataReader class from the Cuemon.Data.CsvClient namespace (including the namespace)
- MERGED Cuemon.Data.SqlClient namespace to its own assembly
- REFACTORED InOperator class in the Cuemon.Data namespace to be less complex and make usage of InOperatorResult
- REMOVED QueryUtility class from the Cuemon.Data namespace
- REMOVED legacy-leftover, IsReadOnly property, from DataTransferRowCollection in the Cuemon.Data namespace
- REMOVED GetPagedRows from the DataTransfer class in the Cuemon.Data namespace

- ADDED InOperatorResult class in the Cuemon.Data namespace that provides the result of an InOperator{T} operation
- ADDED TokenBuilder class in the Cuemon.Data namespace that represents a mutable string of characters optimized for tokens
- ADDED DatabaseDependency class in the Cuemon.Data namespace that provides a way to monitor any changes occurred to one or more relational data sources while notifying subscribing objects
